# ✨ Cozy Cottage ✨

A game where you can explore a wonderful little cottage tucked away in the woods. Rather odd place for a cottage to be you may suppose but none the less you venture in and, alas, the door seems to be jammed. Perhaps there is something in this quaint little place that may pry open that door? It is rather intriguing how small it is, peculiar even. And you can't help but feel as if something is watching you...

## How to build

*Windows*

Open git bash to the directory containing this repository.

```
project-template $ mkdir build
project-template $ cd build
project-template/build $ cmake ..
project-template/build $ start project-template.sln
```

Your solution file should contain four projects.
To run from the git bash command shell, 

```
Horror-Game/build $ ../bin/Debug/demo.exe
```

*macOS*

Open terminal to the directory containing this repository.

```
Horror-Game $ mkdir build
Horror-Game $ cd build
Horror-Game/build $ cmake ..
Horror-Game/build $ make
```

To run each program from build, you would type

```
Horror-Game/build $ ../bin/demo
```

## Idea and Potential Future Mechanics

The idea behind this game is that the player is trapped in a rather small house (two rooms). They are free to explore the space and are able to see via a "flashlight" (spotlight). However, little do they know that behind them is a rather ominous prescence watching their every move. 
For future mechanics, I was thinking of making it an escape room style game where the player could potentially escape the scene by finding clues hidden throughout the space. This would involve object interactibility.
